# House Price Prediction Project

## Project Description
This project aims to predict house prices based on various property features using machine learning algorithms. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and evaluation of multiple regression models such as Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso.  
Additionally, the project includes an interactive user input interface for predicting house prices in real-time.

### Why this project?
- Helps potential buyers and sellers estimate realistic house prices.  
- Demonstrates practical application of regression algorithms in real estate.  
- Provides hands-on experience with data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains house-related features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, basement availability, air conditioning, furnishing status, and more.  

**Note:** The Excel file `HousePricePrediction.xlsx` is included in this repository. Make sure it is located in the same directory as your notebook or script so that it can be loaded properly.

## Features
- Area (square feet)  
- Number of bedrooms  
- Number of bathrooms  
- Number of stories  
- Main road access (yes/no)  
- Guest room availability (yes/no)  
- Basement availability (yes/no)  
- Hot water heating (yes/no)  
- Air conditioning (yes/no)  
- Number of parking spaces  
- Preferred area (yes/no)  
- Furnishing status (furnished / semi-furnished / unfurnished)

## Installation & Setup
You can download or upload all project files including the Jupyter notebook, scripts, and the Excel dataset to your local machine.

Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  
- tabulate  

You can install these libraries using your preferred Python package manager.

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook `HousePricePrediction.ipynb` to explore the dataset, perform analysis, and train machine learning models.  
- Use the interactive script provided (if any) to input property features and get predicted house prices.

## Modeling and Evaluation
Several regression models were trained and evaluated using the following metrics:  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R-squared (R2)  

Models included:  
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  

The best performing model was selected based on these metrics.
